# LinearAlgebra
A set of shoddy programs I created to automate my Linear Algebra homework.

Basic operations and matrix manipulations are modeled.
This allowed me to automate and automatically solve common Linear Algebra problems like Gauss-Jordan Elimination or finding null spaces.

Each function outputs logs into either LaTeX or normal text. This helped me copy-paste solutions into my homework.

These programs were coded sloppily and without rigorous testing.

It is an example of code designed to be _good enough_, able to assist with the busy work of the class.
